# rarVM

This is a rarVM implementation in (R)Python.

There's also a high level language called 'Entish' (file extension .et), which looks like Python but behaves more like C. `run.py` compiles it down to a rarVM binary and executes it.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

```Python
cd src
python run.py examples/simple.et
```
